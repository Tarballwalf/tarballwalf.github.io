## Scripts for creating unlimited Team Drives

These websites allow you to get team drives/shared drives from different school domains

* [Multiple schools](https://td.fastio.me/) (Not Working)
* [Hackgence](https://td.hackgence.com/) (Slowly fading away)
* [Msgsuite](https://td.msgsuite.workers.dev/)

Because of the huge amount of abuse, Goolag has started adding restrictions on EDU domains. Schools and university with a free subscription will ONLY have 100TB of storage for all users IN TOTAL, the more students a university has, the less storage you will have (depending on each user's storage usage).

You can use non profit organizations shared drive (they are not limited yet) but don't abuse them or Goolag will put limits on non profit subscription too.

I suggest getting more then one team drive from different domains and keep backups.

* [University of Sheffield](https://gdrive.zppcw.cn/)
* [Washington University](https://gdrive.oso.ac.cn/)
* [Taiwan Primary School](https://gd.404edu.workers.dev/)
* [SWCCD](https://teamdrive.xcpx.workers.dev/) (Unsafe/Not Working)
* [CCSF](https://teamdrive.mfoxx.workers.dev) (Unsafe/Not Working)

First colum is the name of the team drive. The second colum is Gmail address of the team drive.

If you're worried about the safety of the data in the dives, school admins won't take them down if you keep them private. More information about team drives [here](https://telegra.ph/A-complete-guide-of-shared-drive-Team-drive-01-23)
